# Python Fundamentals 

Welcome to PyTheory, Here..! You are good to go for uncovering the key concepts and important principles of Python Programming Language.
Whether you're new to programming and want to learn the basics, or you're already pretty good and want to learn more, this repository has
something for everyone. I've made sure everything is explained in a simple words.

# 1. Python.

### What is Python ??

Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, or Java. 
Python is a programming language that combines features of C and Java.
Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the year 1990 at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum in the Netherlands and first released in 1991 as a successor of a language called ABC. and Name “Python” picked from TV Show Monty Python’s Flying Circus.its easy-to-learn syntax, dynamic typing, and extensive standard library make it popular for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and automation. Python's active community and vast ecosystem of third-party libraries contribute to its widespread adoption and continuous evolution.

### Python is multi purpose langauage Used for.

* Data Analysis
* AI \ ML
* Automation
* Web Apps
* Mobile Apps
* Desktop Apps
* Software Testing
* Hacking

### Features 

* Easy to learn
* High-Level 
* Huge Community
* Cross-platform
* Large Ecosystem
* Procedure and Object Oriented
* Interpreted Language

### What does an Interpreted language Means.

python is an interpreted language
Before explaining what is an interpreted language,
firstly we need to know about What the "Interpreter" is ? 

### Interpreter.

An interpreter is like a language translator for computers. It reads and understands the code you write in a programming language and then carries out the instructions step by step, line by line, without turning them into a different form first. It helps the computer understand and execute your commands directly, making programming easier and more interactive.

# 2. There are two type of Languages.

1. Interpreted 
2. Compiled 

## Interpreted Languages. 

In interpreted languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, the source code is directly executed by an interpreter. The interpreter reads each line of code, translates it into machine-understandable instructions, and executes it on the fly. This process happens sequentially, without the need for prior compilation into machine code. Interpreted languages often offer benefits such as ease of use, rapid prototyping, and dynamic runtime behavior.

## Compiled Languages.

In compiled languages, such as C, C++, and Java, the source code is first translated into machine-understandable instructions by a compiler. This process is called compilation and typically generates an executable file containing the machine code. The executable file can then be run independently of the compiler. Compiled languages often offer benefits such as faster execution speed and better optimization, but may have a longer development cycle due to the compilation step.

## So Python is an interpreted language

When you write Python code, it's executed by the Python interpreter, which translates and executes the instructions line by line in real-time. This means you can run Python code without the need for a separate compilation step. The Python interpreter reads your code, converts it into intermediate bytecode, and then executes that bytecode directly. This interpretation process allows for quick prototyping, easy debugging, and dynamic runtime behavior, making Python a popular choice for a wide range of applications.


# 3. lets take a breif overview of how Python works?

When the Python software is installed on your machine, minimally, it has:

* Inerpreter.
* A Support Library.

![Example1](https://github.com/IshaqueThePassionate/Python-Fundamentals/blob/main/images/interpreter%20and%20support%20library.png)<br><br>

Python is actually a combination or a ppackage of "Interpreter" and the "Support Library"
so whenever you install Python you get these two things.
Interpreter is used for running the python script,
and the Support library contains all built-in functions, modules, data types etc.

### The Interpreter.

An Interpreter in nothing just a sofware which can run your python script.
Interestingly, it can be implemented in any programming language!

CPython is the default interpreter or an implementation for Python which is written in C programming language.
