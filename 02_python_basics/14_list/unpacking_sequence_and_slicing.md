# Python Unpacking Sequences and Slicing

Python’s unpacking and slicing features allow for efficient data extraction and manipulation from sequences such as lists, tuples, and strings. Below are essential examples—both basic and advanced—that are highly useful in development.

## Unpacking Sequences

Unpacking lets you assign elements from a sequence directly to variables, reducing the need for explicit indexing.

### Basic Unpacking

Assign values from a list to variables in one line.

```python
coords = [51.5074, -0.1278]  # Coordinates for London
lat, lon = coords
print("Latitude:", lat)   # Output: Latitude: 51.5074
print("Longitude:", lon)  # Output: Longitude: -0.1278
```

**Explanation:**  
The list elements are directly unpacked into `lat` and `lon`, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.

### Advanced Unpacking with the `*` Operator

Use the `*` operator to capture multiple values into a list.

```python
data = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
first, *middle, last = data
print("First:", first)     # Output: First: 100
print("Middle:", middle)   # Output: Middle: [200, 300, 400]
print("Last:", last)       # Output: Last: 500
```

**Explanation:**  
`first` captures the first element, `last` the final one, and `*middle` collects all elements in between. This is particularly useful when you need to separate head and tail data from a sequence.

## Slicing Sequences

Slicing enables you to extract parts of a sequence without modifying the original. It works with lists, tuples, and strings.

### Basic Slicing

Extract a subset from a list.

```python
values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
subset = values[1:4]
print(subset)  # Output: [20, 30, 40]
```

**Explanation:**  
`values[1:4]` returns a new list containing the elements from index 1 up to, but not including, index 4.

---

### String Slicing

Extract parts of a string for data processing.

```python
text = "data-analysis"
prefix = text[:4]
suffix = text[-8:]
middle = text[5:13]
print("Prefix:", prefix)   # Output: "data"
print("Middle:", middle)   # Output: "-analysi"
print("Suffix:", suffix)   # Output: "analysis"
```

**Explanation:**  
Slicing a string works the same way as lists. Here, different segments of the string are captured based on index ranges.

### Practical Slicing: Extracting Substrings

Use slicing to extract specific parts of a sentence.

```python
sentence = "Python slicing is efficient"
# Extracting the first word, middle part, and the last word
first_word = sentence.split()[0]
last_word = sentence.split()[-1]
middle_section = sentence[7:14]
print("First word:", first_word)    # Output: "Python"
print("Middle section:", middle_section)  # Output: " slicing"
print("Last word:", last_word)      # Output: "efficient"
```

**Explanation:**  
Splitting the sentence by whitespace helps extract words, while slicing can capture parts based on exact character positions.

### Real-World Example: Parsing Log Data

Suppose you have a log entry with fixed-width fields, and you need to extract specific details.

```python
log_entry = "2023-08-15INFO    User login succeeded   "
# Define slices for date, level, and message
date_slice = slice(0, 10)
level_slice = slice(10, 20)
message_slice = slice(20, None)

date = log_entry[date_slice]
level = log_entry[level_slice].strip()
message = log_entry[message_slice].strip()

print("Date:", date)      # Output: "2023-08-15"
print("Level:", level)    # Output: "INFO"
print("Message:", message)  # Output: "User login succeeded"
```

**Explanation:**  
Using slices with predefined indices extracts fixed-width fields from a log entry. The `strip()` method removes extra whitespace, ensuring clean data extraction.
